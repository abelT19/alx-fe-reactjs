 React Query Demo – Advanced Data Fetching

Overview
This project demonstrates how to fetch, cache, and manage server data efficiently in a React application using **React Query**.  
Instead of manually handling loading states, errors, and caching, React Query simplifies data fetching and improves application performance and user experience.

The app fetches posts from the **JSONPlaceholder API** and shows how React Query handles caching and data updates automatically.
