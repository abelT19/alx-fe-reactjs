 Advanced Routing in React

Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement **advanced routing techniques** in a React application using **React Router**.  
The goal is to show how modern React applications handle complex navigation scenarios such as nested routes, protected routes, and dynamic URLs.

The application includes simulated authentication, user profile sections, and dynamic blog pages to reflect real-world routing use cases.

 Objectives
- Understand and implement client-side routing using React Router
- Create nested routes for better page organization
- Protect sensitive routes using authentication logic
- Handle dynamic routes with variable URL parameters
- Improve navigation flow and application structure

Technologies Used
- React (Vite)
- React Router DOM
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS
